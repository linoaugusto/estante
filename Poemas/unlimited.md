<h1>Unlimited Blade Works (Shirou Version)<h1>

<p>My body is made out of swords.<br>
My blood is of iron and my heart of glass.<br>
I have overcome countless battlefields.<br>
Not even once retreating,<br>
Not even once being victorious.<br>
The bearer lies here alone, forging iron in a hill of swords.<br>
Thus, my life needs no meaning.<br>
This body is made out of infinite swords.</p>

<h1>Unlimited Blade Works (Archer Version)</h1>

<p>My body is made out of swords.<br>
My blood is of iron and my heart of glass.<br>
I have overcome countless battlefields.<br>
Not even once retreating,<br>
Not even once being understood.<br>
He was always alone, intoxicated with victory in a hill of swords.<br>
Thus, his life has no meaning.<br>
That body was certainly made out of swords.</p>
